# QuantEM JEE Academy Website Redesign

This repository contains the complete redesign and redevelopment of the QuantEM JEE Academy website. The website was redeveloped as a part of my second year summer internship with Quantem Edutech. The primary aim of the project was to enhance the overall aesthetic, improve user experience and optimize the performance of the website.

##Live Website : [QuantEM JEE Academy](https://quantemjeeacademy.com/).

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting

## Project Overview

The original website was overhauled to provide a modern, interactive and responsive interface. We ensured compatibility across different screen sizes and browsers to deliver a seamless user experience.

The back-end infrastructure was redesigned to handle increased web traffic efficiently. The website is hosted on AWS, providing high availability, scalability and robustness.

## Reflection

This was a 3-month long project during my second year summer internship at Quantem Edutech. The project's main challenges were to maintain the website's legacy features while introducing new features and handling potential security issues. We achieved the goal by diligent planning, constant testing, and validation at every development phase.

## Future Updates

- Optimize the website for better SEO results
- Enhance mobile experience by improving the mobile version of the website
- Incorporate a blog section for articles and other resources
- Further improve UI/UX based on user feedback
